Power BI dashboards are interactive and visually rich tools designed to present data insights in a consolidated, real-time view. They enable users to monitor key metrics, analyze trends, and support decision-making across business functions. In HR analytics, Power BI dashboards typically display KPIs such as employee turnover, retention rate, headcount distribution, hiring pipeline, and performance evaluations. These dashboards integrate data from various sources (Excel, HRMS, databases) and present it through charts, graphs, filters, and slicers, allowing users to drill down into specific insights. With its drag-and-drop interface and real-time data updates, Power BI empowers HR professionals to identify workforce trends, predict outcomes, and drive strategic initiatives efficiently.
